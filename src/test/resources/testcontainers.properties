# Testcontainers configuration for Docker detection and container reuse

# Enable container reuse for faster test execution during development
# Containers will persist between test runs and be reused when possible
#
# NOTE: TestContainers doesn't read this specific property from this file, 
#       normally they recommend users create a ~/.testcontainers.properties 
#       to set the property.
#
#       This is unnecessary because we set the property via environment vars 
#       to true in the docker-compose.yml. 
#
#       Leaving this comment and property to avoid future confusion.

# testcontainers.reuse.enable=true

# Docker host detection
# Use the default Docker socket detection (works for Docker Desktop, Podman, etc.)
